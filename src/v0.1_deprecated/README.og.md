## About
stocksight is a crowd-sourced stock analysis open source software that uses Elasticsearch to store Twitter and news headlines data for stocks. stocksight analyzes the emotions of what the author writes and does sentiment analysis on the text to determine how the author "feels" about a stock. stocksight makes an aggregated analysis of all collected data from all sources.

Each user running stocksight has a unique fingerprint: specific stocks they are following, news sites and twitter users they follow to find information for those stocks. This creates a unique sentiment analysis for each user, based on what data sources they are getting stocksight to search. Users can have the same stocks, but their data sources could vary significantly creating different sentiment analysis for the same stock. stocksight website will allow each user to see other sentiment analysis results from other stocksight user app results and a combined aggregated view of all.

## How to use

Install python requirements using pip

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Create a new twitter application and generate your consumer key and access token. https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/developer-portal/guides/apps.html
https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/authentication/guides/access-tokens.html

Copy config.py.sample to config.py

Set elasticsearch settings in config.py for your env

Add twitter consumer key/access token and secrets to config.py

Edit config.py and modify NLTK tokens required/ignored and twitter feeds you want to mine. NLTK tokens required are keywords which must be in tweet before adding it to Elasticsearch (whitelist). NLTK tokens ignored are keywords which if are found in tweet, it will not be added to Elasticsearch (blacklist).

### Examples

Run sentiment.py to create 'stocksight' index in Elasticsearch and start mining and analyzing Tweets using keywords

```sh
$ python sentiment.py -k TSLA,'Elon Musk',Musk,Tesla --debug
```

Start mining and analyzing Tweets from feeds in config using cached user ids from file

```sh
$ python sentiment.py -f twitteruserids.txt --debug
```

Start mining and analyzing News headlines and following headline links and scraping relevant text on landing page

```sh
$ python sentiment.py -n TSLA --followlinks --debug
```

Run stockprice.py to add stock prices to 'stocksight' index in Elasticsearch

```sh
$ python stockprice.py -s TSLA --debug
```

Load 'stocksight' index in Kibana and import export.json file for visuals/dashboard.
